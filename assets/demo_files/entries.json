I know that most people aren’t on Bluesky yet, but when you get there, you should know that you won’t be posting. You’ll be skeeting.</p>\n<p>I could do some explanation of it being a portmanteau of “sky” + “posting” but I think we just hit the sicko event horizon and a bunch of shitposters logged on over the last 24 hours, including a bunch who didn’t bother with Mastodon. Anyway it’s skeeting now. Sorry if you don’t like it. Skeet, skeet, motherfucker.</p>\n<p>Also, it’s not the timeline, it’s the skyline. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23701021/dril-bluesky-twitter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">Dril is there</a>. There’s been a main character incident. Quote tweets are happening but you can’t block anyone and muting doesn’t work. It’s pure PVP and no Elon Musk. Also no DMs, so you’re going to have to be horny on main.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bluesky’s first...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23701551/bluesky-skeets-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">Continue reading…</a>\n  </p>",
